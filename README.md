### How to use
1. At first, you should [install the F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it's an alternative app store for Android.
2. Now you can copy the following [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwatrden/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint={fingerprint-hash}), then add this repository to your F-Droid client:

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwarden/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint={fingerprint-hash}
    ```

    Alternatively, you can also scan this QR code:

    <p align="center">
      <img src=".github/qrcode.png?raw=true" alt="F-Droid repo QR code"/>
    </p>

3. Open the link in F-Droid. It will ask you to add the repository. Everything should already be filled in correctly, so just press "OK".
4. You can now install Bitwarden apps, e.g. start by searching for "Bitwarden" in the F-Droid client.

Please note that some apps published here might contain [Anti-Features](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/). If you can't find an app by searching for it, you can go to settings and enable "Include anti-feature apps".
